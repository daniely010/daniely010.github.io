  <h1>Elephants of the World</h1>
  <p>The gentle giants that shape our ecosystems.</p>
</div> <!--I added a closing div tag because each opening div tag has to be followed with a closing div tag after if there are multiple opening div tags to keep correct HTML structure. Otherwise, functional issues with the code may occur.-->

<div class="section"> <!--I added quotation marks around section. The error here causes the broswer to get confused and misread the code. It might think parts of the value are seperate attributes or get the wrong value completely.-->
  <h2>About Elephants</h2>
<p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth. They are highly intelligent and form
strong family bonds led by a matriarch. They use their trunks for eating, drinking, and
communication. </p> <!--I added the opening p tag that was missing at the start of the paragraph. Not adding the opening p tag is a bug because the broswer doesn't know where the paragraph begins, so it cannot use paragraph formatting properly-->
</div> <!--I moved the div closing tag from all the way at the bottom of the code to here because there are multiple divs so i have to seperate each section with closing div tags. This is so I keep correct HTML structure to avoid issues with the code functioning.-->
