  <h2>About Elephants</h2>
<p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth. They are highly intelligent and form
strong family bonds led by a matriarch. They use their trunks for eating, drinking, and
communication. </p> <!--I added the opening p tag that was missing at the start of the paragraph. Not adding the opening p tag is a bug because the broswer doesn't know where the paragraph begins, so it cannot use paragraph formatting properly-->

  <p>This light blue box is the parent element.</p>
<div class="child-box">
  <p>This smaller box is <strong>positioned absolutely</strong> inside its parent.</p>
<!--I added everything starting from divclass=parent box to here. The bug was a grouping error, incorrect grouping of elements which means these elements are not grouped together inside a container (section) which breaks page structure and CSS application.-->

  <h2 class="sticky-title">Types of Elephants</h2>
  <p>There are three main species of elephants — each adapted to its own habitat:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>African Savannah Elephant:</strong> Found in open grasslands.</li>
<li><strong>African Forest Elephant:</strong> Smaller, lives in dense forests.</li>
<li><strong>Asian Elephant:</strong> Found across South and Southeast Asia.</li>
<!--Deleted random closing list tag that was not needed. The bug can confuse broswers and also break the list display.-->
</ul> <!--Added a closing ul tag. Without it, the bug will cause the broswer to not correctly recognize the list and cause layout and display problems-->
<div class="info-box">
  <p><strong>Fun fact: Elephant ears help regulate body temperature!</strong></p> <!--Added the closing strong tag. The bug is that if there is no closing strong tag, the broswer doesn't know where the strong emphasis ends and can break the visual layout an the html structure-->
