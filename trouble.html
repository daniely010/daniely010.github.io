  <h1>Elephants of the World</h1>

</div> <!--Missing closing div tag. This bug causes the browser to not know where the container ends, so it treats all following content as part of the hero section, breaking layout and styling because the container is never properly closed. It can cause unexpected display problems and structure confusion.-->

<div class="section"> <!--I added quotation marks around section. The error here causes the broswer to get confused and misread the code. It might think parts of the value are seperate attributes or get the wrong value completely. Without quotes, the browser might misinterpret the attribute, causing wrong or unpredictable parsing of the element and its contents.-->
  <h2>About Elephants</h2>
<p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth. They are highly intelligent and form
strong family bonds led by a matriarch. They use their trunks for eating, drinking, and
communication. </p> <!--I added the opening p tag that was missing at the start of the paragraph. Not adding the opening p tag is a bug because the broswer doesn't know where the paragraph begins, so it cannot use paragraph formatting properly. Browsers won’t apply paragraph-related styles correctly, leading to broken formatting and visual issues.-->
<div class="parent-box">
  <p>This light blue box is the parent element.</p>
<div class="child-box">
  <p>This smaller box is <strong>positioned absolutely</strong> inside its parent.</p>
<!--I added everything starting from divclass=parent box to here. The bug was a grouping error, incorrect grouping of elements which means these elements are not grouped together inside a container (section) which breaks page structure and CSS application.-->

  <h2 class="sticky-title">Types of Elephants</h2>
  <p>There are three main species of elephants — each adapted to its own habitat:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>African Savannah Elephant:</strong> Found in open grasslands.</li>
<li><strong>African Forest Elephant:</strong> Smaller, lives in dense forests.</li>
<li><strong>Asian Elephant:</strong> Found across South and Southeast Asia.</li>
<!--Deleted random closing list tag that was not needed. The bug can confuse broswers and also break the list display.-->
</ul> <!--Added a closing ul tag. Without it, the bug will cause the broswer to not correctly recognize the list and cause layout and display problems-->
<div class="info-box">
  <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Elephant ears help regulate body temperature!</p> <!--Added the closing strong tag. The bug is that if there is no closing strong tag, the broswer doesn't know where the strong emphasis ends and can break the visual layout an the html structure. Also, Styles or emphasis can "bleed" into subsequent text, creating layout and styling bugs.​-->

  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<div class="facts-container">
<div class="fact-card">🐘 Elephants can recognize themselves in mirrors.</div> <!-- Added closing div tag that was beside the closing div tag on the 3rd one. The bug makes the opening div tag to not have a matching closing div tag, breaking structure.-->

<div class="fact-card">🌿 They eat up to 300 pounds of food per day!</div> <!--Deleted uneccessary closing div tag that needed to be on the 1st one. The bug has an unmatched closing tag that breaks structure.-->

<div id="footer"> <!--Added > at the end of the "footer". The bug where the footer’s opening div tag is missing the closing angle bracket > causes the browser to misinterpret the start of the footer element. As a result, the entire footer section fails to render correctly, and associated styles like background color and text color won’t be applied.-->
