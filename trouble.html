  <h1>Elephants of the World</h1>

</div> <!--I added a closing div tag because each opening div tag has to be followed with a closing div tag after if there are multiple opening div tags to keep correct HTML structure. Otherwise, functional issues with the code may occur.-->

<div class="section"> <!--I added quotation marks around section. The error here causes the broswer to get confused and misread the code. It might think parts of the value are seperate attributes or get the wrong value completely.-->
  <h2>About Elephants</h2>
<p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth. They are highly intelligent and form
strong family bonds led by a matriarch. They use their trunks for eating, drinking, and
communication. </p> <!--I added the opening p tag that was missing at the start of the paragraph. Not adding the opening p tag is a bug because the broswer doesn't know where the paragraph begins, so it cannot use paragraph formatting properly-->
</div> <!--I moved the div closing tag from all the way at the bottom of the code to here because there are multiple divs so i have to seperate each section with closing div tags. This is so I keep correct HTML structure to avoid issues with the code functioning.-->

  <h2 class="sticky-title">Types of Elephants</h2>
  <p>There are three main species of elephants — each adapted to its own habitat:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>African Savannah Elephant:</strong> Found in open grasslands.</li>
<li><strong>African Forest Elephant:</strong> Smaller, lives in dense forests.</li>
<li><strong>Asian Elephant:</strong> Found across South and Southeast Asia.</li>
<!--Deleted random closing list tag that was not needed. The bug can confuse broswers and also break the list display.-->
</ul> <!--Added a closing ul tag. Without it, the bug will cause the broswer to not correctly recognize the list and cause layout and display problems-->
</div> <!--Moved the closing div tag from the bottom of both of these sections. Each opening div tag needs its matching closing div tag to properly contain all the elements in it. If not, the bug will cause display problems-->

<div class="info-box">
  <p><strong>Fun fact: Elephant ears help regulate body temperature!</strong></p> <!--Added the closing strong tag. The bug is that if there is no closing strong tag, the broswer doesn't know where the strong emphasis ends and can break the visual layout an the html structure-->

<div class="fact-card">🐘 Elephants can recognize themselves in mirrors.</div> <!-- Added closing div tag that was beside the closing div tag on the 3rd one. The bug makes the opening div tag to not have a matching closing div tag, breaking structure.-->

<div class="fact-card">🌿 They eat up to 300 pounds of food per day!</div> <!--Deleted uneccessary closing div tag that needed to be on the 1st one. The bug has an unmatched closing tag that breaks structure.-->
