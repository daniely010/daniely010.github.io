    <img src="https://www.uksport.gov.uk/-/media/images/sports/flag-football/flag-football-3.ashx?bc=White&h=320&iar=0&w=576&hash=B4759E197D841D8F8529A9E26BBA529D&crop=1&cropx=50&cropy=50">
    <h2>Basic rules:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No tackling:</strong> Instead of tackling, players pull a flag from the belt of whoever has the ball</li>
      <li><strong>5 players on the field:</strong> The game is usually played with smaller teams with less people than traditional football</li>
      <li><strong>First downs:</strong> Teams must advance the ball a certain distance (around half the field) to regain first down</li>
      <li><strong>QB:</strong> Quarterbacks are not allowed forward movement or running unless it's a direct handoff</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Touchdown:</strong> Worth 6 points</li>
      <li><strong>Conversion:</strong> After a touchdown, teams can earn 1 or 2 points for 1 extra play</li>
      <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Worth 2 points if a down occurs in the offense's endzone</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Daniel's opinion</h2>
    <p>
      I think flag football is a <strong>fun</strong> and <em>safe</em> alternative to tackle football. It allows the fun and excitement of the game to be played without much risk of injury.
