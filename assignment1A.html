      <h2>How Flag Football differs from Tackle Football</h2>
        <p>Flag football is a non-contact sport where players wear flags attached to their waist. Instead of tackling the ball carrier to stop the play, defenders pull one of these flags. This means there are no hard hits or tackles, making the game safer and less physical than tackle football.</p>
        <p>Tackle football is the traditional, full-contact version. Players block, tackle, and physically compete for control of the ball. It requires helmets, shoulder pads, and other protective gear to keep players safe during hits and collisions.</p>
      <h3>Key Differences</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Level of Contact:</strong> Flag football has no tackling or blocking; tackle football includes full contact and physical collisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Flag football needs minimal gear like a flag belt and mouthguard; tackle football requires helmets, pads, cleats, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Number of Players:</strong> Flag football teams are smaller (usually 5-7 players) and played on smaller fields; tackle football has 11 players per side on a full-sized field.</li>
        <li><strong>Rules:</strong> Flag football emphasizes speed, agility, and strategy with simpler rules; tackle football includes more complex plays, blocking, and special teams.</li>
      </ul>
